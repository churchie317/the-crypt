TOY CIPHER: NOT FOR ENCRYPTION PURPOSES

Toy cipher that encrypts and decrypts using Vigenere-based encryption and dictionary algorithms. 
Caesar ciphers are randomly generated; therefore, identical plaintexts will often encrypt to non-identical cipher texts.
Before encrypting, ensure that all words in plaintext exist in accompanying dictionary, as well as recipient dictionary.
